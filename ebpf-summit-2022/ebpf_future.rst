The Future of eBPF in the Linux Kernel
--------------------------------------

The first patch of eBPF was sent in September 2013.
The most complex of eBPF is the verifier.

The goal of eBPF is to enable people to innovate.

The BPF "restricted C" is safe while Rust is a safER C.
BTF relies on structure to be compiled with `preserve_access_index` which is an attribute proper to the LLVM bpf backend.
