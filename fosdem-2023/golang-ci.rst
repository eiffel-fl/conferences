Dagger
======

Dagger is a programmable and portable solution.
You can run your CI pipeline anywhere: if it runs locally then you can be confident it will do everywhere.
You can write pipeline in your favorite language.
You also avoid vendor lock-in, by writing a layer which abstracts the underlying CI system (e.g. GitHub Actions).
There is a lot of caching in Dagger like the one in Dockerfiles: if you do not need to run something again it will not be run again.

To use dagger SDK, you need to import the dagger.io golang package.

TL;DR: Do no do live demo!
