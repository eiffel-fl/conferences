Database troubleshooting is falling on the shoulders of developpers whom needs are different than database admins.
Opentelemetry is a set of tools to catter and gather metrics.

But there is no OpenTelemetry for databases.
Sqlcommenter addresses this problem by extending vision of databases to OpenTelemetry.
It was donated to OpenTelemetry in september 2021.

sqlcommenter adds comment to SQL requests.
The comments help to trace which code generates a given request.
