Building Tech Communities
-------------------------

Enterprises need t be agile but their teams are siloed.
Building a tech community can be useful to, among others:

1. Succesfully introduce a technology.
2. Remove duplicated work.
3. Share the knowledge between teams.
4. Ease recruitment.

You should identify early adopters, either via entreprise resources (wiki, *etc.*) or external events.
Then, you should put them in touch with each others by, for example, facilitating a presentation (even from someone outside the company).
The speaker thinks you need someone to drive it and as a leader and to get support, but not approval, from business.

Once you setup the ground, you should schedule regular events.
If the community begins to live, you should formalieze it by giving it resources (*e.g.* wiki page, slack, company events, blogs, *etc.*).
You should also need to handle the content generating both internal (*e.g.* presentation, wiki, *etc.*) and external (*e.g*, blogging, presentations, *etc.*).
